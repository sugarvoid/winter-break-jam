My submission for the [Winter Break Bullet Hell Jam](https://itch.io/jam/2023-winter-bullet-hell-jam)

The plan is to make a bullet hell game, with no randomness. 


## Goal :dart:
- Dodge the ice sickles for 2 minutes.

## Controls :joystick: 
|Key|Action|
|:---:|:---:|
|A|Move Left|
|D|Move Right|
|Space|Jump|

## To-Do
- Keep music playing after dying
- Replace danger object with just ice sickle
- Make death marker work if player fall off screen
- Make ice sickles not look like nails
- Make player freeze if not moving over 3 sec
- Add bar in middle to prevent jump across?? 
- Add Credits screen
- Add pause feature(maybe be)
